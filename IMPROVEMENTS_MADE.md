# Major Improvements Made to CodePrep AI

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ OpenAI API Issue - FIXED
**Problem:** API was trying to use GPT-4 model which requires paid tier
**Solution:**

  - Interview generation
  - Feedback generation
  - Resume enhancement

**Status:** ✅ AI interviews now work perfectly!

### 2. ✅ Empty Challenges Section - FIXED
**Problem:** No coding challenges were available
**Solution:**
- Created 6 comprehensive DSA challenges covering:
  - Arrays (Two Sum)
  - Strings (Valid Parentheses, Longest Substring)
  - Linked Lists (Merge Two Sorted Lists)
  - Trees (Binary Tree Inorder Traversal)
  - Dynamic Programming (Maximum Subarray)
- Created seed script: `backend/seedChallenges.js`
- Challenges include:
  - Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium)
  - Starter code in 5 languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Go)
  - Test cases with hidden cases
  - Solutions with explanations
  - Time/space complexity analysis
  - Company tags (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.)
  - Hints for solving

**How to add more challenges:**
```bash
cd backend
node seedChallenges.js
```

**Status:** ✅ Challenges section now fully functional!
